A platform for you who like anime action figures.

we currently have no backend application yet, but we make a mocking api.
to run it you need to install `json-server` globally. if you already install then run the commands

```
json-server --watch ./src/mocking/db.json
```

after the mocking api running you can run the react app by using command

```
npm run dev
```
